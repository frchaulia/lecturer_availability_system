## Background of the Problem

In educational institutions, it is often challenging for students to determine the availability of lecturers, especially when they need to meet or consult with them. Traditionally, students have to physically visit the lecturer's room or rely on word-of-mouth information, which can be unreliable and time-consuming. This lack of real-time availability information can lead to frustration and inefficient use of time for both students and lecturers.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the Real-Time Lecturer Availability System are:

1. To provide real-time tracking and monitoring of lecturer availability in various rooms using Wi-Fi technology.
2. To streamline the process of accessing lecturer availability information for students and other stakeholders.
3. To improve communication and coordination between students and lecturers.
4. To enhance the overall efficiency and productivity of the educational institution.


## Features

- Real-time detection and tracking of lecturer devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.) through active Wi-Fi connections in each room.
- Processing and transmitting availability data from microcontrollers to a central application server using Cloud Computing technology via the Wi-Fi network.
- Storage and management of lecturer availability records in a cloud-based database.
